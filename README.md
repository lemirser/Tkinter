Tkinter description directly from the youtube playlist:
> Tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the Graphic User Interfaces (GUI applications) with Python. Tkinter comes with Python already, so there's nothing to install! 

## Dependencies
1. Since Tkinter comes with Python, you don't need to install it.
2. As of date of this repo creation, I'm using Python 3.7.0.
